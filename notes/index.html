	<p>-Of Apoorva Kumar</p>
</div><div class="topcontent">
    <p><font size="6">The Beginning</font></p>
	<p>I came to know about GSOC through one of my friends who is a mentee of Himanshu Mishra.He told me that you have to learn python for participating in GSOC.He also gave me some other details.Before that moment I didn't knew about GSOC.But after that moment it slowly caught my Imagination.There was a feeling like 'This is it'.But still I was clueless like "How to do it"</p>
	<p>(Actually I am really a noobie in the field of coding.I was unknown to field of coding before coming to college)</p>
</div><div class="topcontent">
    <p><font size="6">Intro Seminar</font></p>
	<p>As my EAA is NCC & I was going to attend the camp.So from 28th I started calling NCC officials for getting a leave from the camp.On the day of intro seminar from morning I was asking officials that I needed to go for a very "Branch relevant workshop. That's why it's being held in my department :) :) :) :) ".I finally got my leave to attend the workshop.But after attending the workshop I was still clueless .I just knew that how to send a pull request.(But it was a much needed starting point)</p>
</div><div class="topcontent">
    <p><font size="6">Winter Workshop</font></p>
	<p>Till this time I had got a basic feel of python.People told me to fork those projects which I'm interested in.</p>
	<p><font size="4">Hence I forked projects on AI.& then nothing happened :) :)</font></p>
	<p>And then I met a person in Winter Workshop</p>
</div>
<div class="topcontent">
<p><font size="6">Pranit Bauva</font></p>
<p>He acted as my mentor.One more thing I was still clueless till this time</p>
<p><font size="4">How he helped me ? </font></p>
<p>He told me to fork projects which is strictly based on python</p>
<p>Later due to some reason my project mentor was unavailable & at that time Pranit Bauva guided me.  </p>
<p>Even though they seem insignificant but they were actually very significant.Thanks Pranit.</p>
<p>Better visit his fb profile for his introduction,Link is given below</p>

<p><font size="6">Notes2ppt</font></p>
<p>When I started working on Notes2ppt, It was in a very  juvenile state.Actually this project deals with Optical character recognition that is extracting tect from image .It's motive is to build ppts from hand written notes,using Tesseract.Pre image processing is done through Opencv.PPt's are generated through python pptx & wiki api.Pyenchant & NLTK is used for spell-checking.</p>
<p>Gunjan Sengupta has described the working of Notes2ppt in a very simple manner & fluent manner.Anyone can follow the instruction easily.But setting up the condition to work on was quite difficult.</p>

<p><font size="6">Basic working of Notes2ppt </font></p>
<p>
	First Canny edge detector is applied to find edges
	
</p>
<img  class="resize2"src="pic4.png" >
<p>Then by using approx poly DP contours are detected,then From those contours, contour with biggest area is selected</p>
<img  class="resize2"src="5.png" >
<p>Image is processed for text extraction</p>
<img  class="resize2"src="6.png" >
<p>Now tesseract engine extracts text</p>
<img  class="resize2"src="8.png" >
<p>OS package is imported to run spellcheck.py to remove spelling mistakes & delete warped.png(os.remove)(black image with white text)</p>

<img  class="resize2"src="9.png" >

<p>This is interpreter demonstration of Spellchecker(Handwritten package)</p>

<p><font size ="6"> Problems faced </font></p>
<p>Most of the problem was getting solved by googling but there was one problem which I was not able to solve myself as I was not able to understand the error.When I was tokenizing the raw text extracted by tesseract,terminal was continuously giving ascii error.As I was not fluent in tokenizers I was trying to find fault in that function.But after my long wasted effort I was told to use this to remove ascii error "tokens+=nltk.word_tokenize(re.sub(r'[^\x00-\x7F]+',' ', line))"</p>
</div>
<div class="topcontent">

<p><font size="6">Only this much ???????</font></p>
<p>No!!!.There are other function on which I'm still working so that I can send new PR's.Image processing algo will also be improved.</p>

<p>Now after all this I want to brag about myself.It was no:5.For me it's really cool</p>
